# Symfony 2 GraphQl Bundle1

Use Facebook GraphQL with Laravel 5. It is based on the PHP implementation [here](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php). 
You can find more information about GraphQL in the [GraphQL Introduction](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html) 
on the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) blog or you can read the [GraphQL specifications](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/). This is a work in progress.
